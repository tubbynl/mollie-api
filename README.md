This library is available on my [personal maven repository](https://github.com/stil4m/maven-repository), which is hosted on GitHub.

To use this with library with Maven, add the following snippets to your `pom.xml` file:

```
...
<repository>
    <id>stil4m-releases</id>
    <name>stil4m-releases</name>
    <url>https://github.com/stil4m/maven-repository/raw/master/releases/</url>
</repository>

...

<depencency>
    <groupId>nl.stil4m</groupId>

```
To use this with library with Gradle, add the following snippets to your `build.gradle` file:
```
...
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        url "https://github.com/stil4m/maven-repository/raw/master/releases/"
    }
}
...
dependencies {
    ...
    runtime 'nl.stil4m:mollie-api:2.3.0'
}
```

## Build the JAR

To build the `JAR` you can run `mvn install`.


## Usage

### Setup 

You can use the API with a static defined Mollie API key `Client` or a dynamic key `DynamicClient`.

#### Static

```
Client client = new ClientBuilder()
					.withApiKey(""XXX")
					.build();
```

#### Dynamic

```
DynamicClient client = new DynamicClientBuilder()
							.build();
```

#### Configuration

Both clients make use of the Jackson `ObjectMapper` and the Apache HTTP `HttpClient`. These can be respectively configured using `withMapper` and `withClient`.

> Note 1: The library uses `jackson-datatype-jdk8`. To make sure that the `ObjectMapper` can serialise `java.util.Optional` the library registers the module in the `ObjectMapper`.

> Note 2: The `ObjectMapper` has the `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` property disabled by default to make the deserialisation more forgiving ([#25](https://github.com/stil4m/mollie-api/issues/25)). If you inject your own `ObjectMapper`, please consider disabling this property: When Mollie adds a property and you do not disable this, and they do this now and then, deserialisation will fail with an exception. 



### API Calls

The API is separated into different concepts:

* Methods: Used to read the available payment methods.
* Issuers: Used to read the available issuers per payment method.
* Payments: Used to create read and delete payments
* Refunds: Used to create read and delete refunds on payments
* Status: Used to verify the validity of the used API key
 
All concepts can be retrieved from the client using the following format `client.<concept>()`.

For example you can create a payment as follows:

```
Client client = new ClientBuilder()
					.withApiKey(""XXX")
					.build();
					
client.payments().create(new CreatePayment(...));
```
